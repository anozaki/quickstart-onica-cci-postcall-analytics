This Quick Start deploys a serverless architecture to perform analytics on post-call data for contact center solutions. It creates an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for dropping call recordings. Call recordings are processed using Amazon Transcribe for automatic speech recognition to create high-quality transcript. Amazon Comprehend performs natural language processing on the transcripts and stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket within Amazon DynamoDB tables.

You can also use Amazon QuickSight to view the collected data and access the operational dashboards and reports.
