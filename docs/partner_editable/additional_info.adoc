== Test the deployment

. Make a note of the portal URL in the *Output* section of the master stack with key PortalEndpoint.

. Create a user in Amazon Cognito under the *UserPool* that is created by the stack. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html[Creating User Accounts as Administrator^] to learn how to create a user in a Cognito pool. By default, user names in this application must be full email addresses, and passwords must contain at least one numeric, uppercase, lowercase and special characters. These constraints can be changed within the Cognito console.

. If you are logged in to your AWS account in a browser window already, open the portal endpoint in a different incognito browser window, as the portal attaches an Amazon QuickSight user role that can interfere with your actual role.

. Go to the portal and log in with the created user. Upon initial login, you are prompted to change the temporary password. After you’ve successfully changed the password, you are directed to the main page where you can see the home page, as shown in the following figure.

. Choose the *Upload* button (located in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar), and upload your audio files.
. After a successful upload, the audio processing runs through transcription and text analysis.
. Choose the *Call Analytics* logo in the top-left corner of the navigation bar to return to home page, as shown in the following figure.

[#mainPageWithCalls]
.Portal page with calls

. Open a call to see the call classifications and turn-by-turn sentiments that are provided by Amazon Comprehend.
. Choose the play icon on each call to play back the original audio file. Note that supported file formats are determined by the browser, and playback implementation is handled through the HTML5 audio control.

== Post deployment steps

Perform the following steps to create Amazon QuickSight dashboards and visualizations to see call analytics and insights.

WARNING: Before you use QuickSight to create visualizations, make sure you have uploaded some audio files so that the AWS Glue crawler can create a table from the text_analysis_output Amazon S3 bucket. The crawlers are set to run every hour. You can manually run the crawler if it hasn’t run yet. The table must exist prior to connecting QuickSight and Amazon Athena.

=== Subscribe to Amazon QuickSight

. Sign in to your AWS account in a different browser window than the one that is running the portal site (or use an incognito browswer). Otherwise, the QuickSight user roles might conflict.
. To open QuickSight, navigate to the *Analytics* section in the AWS Management Console, and search for *QuickSight*. Your AWS account number is displayed for verification purposes. 
. Choose *Sign up for QuickSight*.
. Choose *Standard*. To confirm, choose *Continue*. 
. On the *Create your QuickSight account* page, perform these steps:
** Type a unique name for your QuickSight subscription account. Your account name can contain only characters (A–Z and a–z), digits (0–9), and hyphens (-).
** Type your email address to receive QuickSight service and usage notifications.
** (Optional) Choose the AWS Region for your default Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine (SPICE) capacity. This Region is where your account’s free SPICE capacity is allocated after signing up. Note that you can't change the default capacity Region later, but you can purchase additional SPICE capacity in different Regions as needed. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/regions.html[AWS Regions, Websites, IP Address Ranges, and Endpoints^].
** (Optional) Choose whether to allow autodiscovery of your AWS resources. Give QuickSight access to the S3 buckets that begin with text_analysis_output and text_analysis_athena_results. You can change these options later in the *Manage Account* section. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/autodiscover-aws-data-sources.html[Allowing Autodiscovery of AWS Resources^].
. Review your choices, and choose *Finish*.

After you have completed these steps successfully, you can explore Amazon QuickSight and its features.

To access QuickSight from the portal website, choose the QuickSight button in the center of the navigation bar. Provide your email address to associate with QuickSight.

=== Create new analysis
Perform these steps:
. Choose *New analysis* in the top-left corner of the page.
. Choose *New Dataset*.
. Choose *Athena*.
. Enter a name for the data source.
. Choose *Create Datasource*.
. Select *Use custom SQL*.
. Go to Athena in your AWS console.
. Choose *Saved Queries*.
. Select the query named *Select Turn by turn sentiments*.
. Copy the query.
. Go back to your QuickSight tab and paste the query in the custom SQL text area.
. Choose *Confirm Query*.
. If the AWS Glue crawler has not run the uploaded audio files yet, the page will display an error message similar to the following figure:
+
[#error]
.Crawler error
[link=images/crawler-error.png]
image::../images/crawler-error.png[Crawler error,width=648,height=439]

. If you receive an error, perform these steps: 
.. Navigate to the AWS Glue service in the AWS Console.
.. Choose *Crawlers*, and select the *text-analysis-metadata-crawler* entry.
.. If the resulting page shows that both tables updated and created are 0, then the crawler hasn’t run yet. To run the crawler, choose the *Run crawler* button and wait for it to complete. After it finishes, the *Tables added* field is set to 1.
. Finish your dataset creation by choosing *Directly query your data*.
. To create an analysis, choose *Visualize*.
